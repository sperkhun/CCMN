# CCMN
In this project, we need to use the Mobility Services Engine (MSE) APIs to enhance
and personalize our applications by leveraging the capabilities of the different components
of the Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) solution. Business uses CMX and MSE
to send targeted messages, this technology increases customers satisfaction and sales by
offering new revenue models through notification messages and promotional campaigns
focused on people passing by. Also, CMX can help to build heatmap, collect statistics
about your visitors.
